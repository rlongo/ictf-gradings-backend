# ICTF Grading Server

The ICTF Grading Server is used to host and manage ICTF grading sessions.
I've primarily developed this application to make my life easier when administrating
a grading session. This session provides the backend to allow for:
- Storage and management of tests
- Storage and management of student lists
- Endpoint to generate forms and other material related to a tests

## Note on the Code

This application is my first GO app and while I intend to use it, this is meant to be a
learning platform as I get a handle on the language.
